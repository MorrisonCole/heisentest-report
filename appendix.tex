\section{Appendix}
\label{sec:appendix}


\subsection{System Manual}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This should include all the technical details that would enable a student to continue your project next year, and be able to amend or extend your code. For example, Where is the code? What do you do to compile and install it?
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\subsection{User Manual}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This should give enough information for someone to use what you have designed and implemented. It is a good place to include screen shots of the application or output.
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\subsection{Supporting documentation or data}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If you have additional data, diagrams or thing s like a set of use case specifications that are relevant to the documentation of your work then they can be included in an appendix section. Don't just include everything, only items that are directly relevant to the documentation or description of your work.
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\subsection{Test results and test reports}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If you have test results that add to the value of the report, but which would not fit within the page limit of the main report, you can include them as an appendix. Don't add them just to pad the report, though.
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\subsection{Project Plan and Interim Report}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Put copies of them into an appendix section. They don't need to be signed copies.
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\subsection{Code Listing}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Your code should be properly presented and formatted neatly. Don't let long lines of code arbitrarily wrap round to the next line, as this looks very messy. In order not to use up too many pages you can switch the paper orientation to lanscape and print the code in two columns.

		In general, don't add more than about 25 pages of code listing to the report. If your code does not fit within 25 pages, you can provide a listing of the most interesting parts of your code (but include around 20-25 pages) or parts of the code you may need to reference from the main chapters. If you don't include everything, it must be clear that this is not the complete listing. State which parts you've included, add a brief explanation of why you've included these particular parts, and provide a brief summary of which code you have omitted.
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

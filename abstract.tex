We present a framework for identifying and accelerating the resolution of \flaky
test cases in a test suite. A flaky test case is one with a low probability of
failure.

To begin, each test's probability of failure is calculated. Then, each test is
adaptively instrumented --- state-logging probes are placed in choice locations.
Finally, aggregated data is analysed to identify predicates strongly associated
with test failure.

Our instrumentation approach applies bug isolation techniques in an ideal
environment, allowing us to record and analyse a huge amount of runtime data
over time. We improve adaptive instrumentation with the introduction of an
instrumentation budget and allocate probes based on measured cost.

We discuss and document the implementation of a working proof of concept, named
\venera, that targets Android applications and integrates with a popular
open-source continuous integration tool. We present preliminary results from the
use of the tool on an Android test suite.

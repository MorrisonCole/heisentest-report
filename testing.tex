% This chapter will typically be 2-4 pages in length but could be more depending on the depth of testing done.
\section{Testing}
\label{sec:testing}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe your testing strategy (unit, functional, acceptance testing and how they are carried out). How were test cases selected?
	\item Examples of specific tests and how they were carried out (e.g., using mock objects to break dependencies). Focus on the interesting cases.
	\item A summary of the test results and what coverage was achieved. The detailed test report(s) should appear in the appendix.
	\item If your project requires substantial evaluation of data and results, or other forms of testing that are not code-based, then adapt this chapter to suit.
\end{itemize}

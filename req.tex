\section{Requirements and Analysis}
\label{sec:req}

\begin{framed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Give the detailed problem statement. This elaborates on what you may have included in the introduction chapter, and represents the starting point from which the requirements were derived.
		\item A structured list of requirements.
		\item Use cases (a use diagram and list of use case titles, with the full use cases appearing in the appendix).
		\item Results of analysing the requirements to extract information. For example, data modelling to find the data to be stored (ER diagram), views/web pages needed and so on.
		\item If your project is not Software Engineering oriented, then you still need to describe the requirements you are working to and relevant analysis information. Use cases may not be needed or relevant.
